    "## **What is `Next.js`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` is a `React framework` that provides a structure to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is built on top of `React` and provides features like `server-side rendering`, `static site generation`, `API routes`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provided features like `file-based routing`, `image optimization`, `Data Fetching`, `Bundling and Minification`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a `Full Stack Framework`, therefore it has `Opinions` and `Conventions` to follow.\n",

    "### **Features of `Next.js`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**File-based Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `Next.js`, the files inside the `pages` directory are automatically mapped to routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, a file named `about.js` inside the `pages` directory will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/about`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` allows you to create API endpoints inside the `pages/api` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can create both `Client Side` React Components and `Server Side` API routes in the same project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rendering Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` supports multiple rendering methods, including `Static Site Generation (SSG)`, `Server-Side Rendering (SSR)`, and `Client-Side Rendering (CSR)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This flexibility allows developers to choose the best rendering method for their specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Fetching**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` provides built-in methods for data fetching, such as `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Styling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` supports various styling options, including `CSS`, `Sass`, `CSS-in-JS`, and `Tailwind CSS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also has built-in support for `CSS Modules`, allowing for scoped and modular styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` has a built-in `Image` component that automatically optimizes images for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It supports features like lazy loading, resizing, and serving images in modern formats like `WebP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also has built-in support for `Internationalization (i18n)`, making it easier to create multilingual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dev and Prod Build System**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` provides a robust build system that optimizes the application for both development and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Developers can only focus on writing code, while `Next.js` handles the build optimizations.\n",

    "**Server Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs all components are Server components by Default\n",
    "\n",
    "They've the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they do not have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "They are traditional React Components.\n",

    "### **Routing in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Next.js` has a file system based routing mechanism. URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "As NextJs is a framework so we will need to follow it's conventions to implement the features it provides. One of the feature is `File` based routing. Having said that we need to know that not every file in our project is `Routable`. Only those files that are inside the `app` folder are `Routable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Routes` we need to create a dedicated folder for each route inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want `localhost:3000/about` then we will need to have a folder `about` inside this folder there should be a `page.tsx` file for routing.\n",

    "## **Dynamic Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic routes are used when we want to create routes that are not predefined and can change based on user input or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dynamic route in Next.js, we use square brackets `[]` to define a dynamic segment in the folder name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we want to show product details based on product ID, we can create a folder named `[id]` inside the `app` folder. Inside this folder, we will have a `page.tsx` file that will handle rendering the product details based on the ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user navigates to a URL like `/product/123`, Next.js will match this URL to the dynamic route defined by the `[id]` folder and pass the value `123` as a parameter to the `page.tsx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Route Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a folder named `product` inside the `app` folder. Also, create `page.tsx` file inside the `product` folder to have a home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `product` folder, create another folder named `[productId]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `[productId]` folder, create a file named `page.tsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When user navigates to `/product/123`, the `page.tsx` file inside the `[productId]` folder will be rendered, and we can access the `productId` as a `Prop` in the `page.tsx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "// src/app/product/[productId]/page.tsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "const ProductPage = async ({ params }: { params: { productId: string } }) => {\n",
    "  const product = await params;\n",
    "  return <div>Product ID: {product.productId}</div>;\n",
    "};\n",
    "export default ProductPage;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we are using `params` prop to access the dynamic segment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can create multiple dynamic segments by adding more folders with square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We receive `productId` as a prop in `products/[productId]/page.tsx` file. But the `params` prop is a `Promise` and we need to use `async/await` to access the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Nested Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create nested dynamic routes by combining static and dynamic segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to create a route for product reviews based on product ID and review ID, we can create the following folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app/product/[productId]/review/[reviewId]/page.tsx`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a route like `/product/123/review/456`, where `123` is the product ID and `456` is the review ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const Reivew = async ({ params }: { params: { productId: string } }) => {\n",
    "  const param = await params;\n",

    "- Here, we are accessing the `productId` from the `params` prop in the `page.tsx` file inside the `review` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Catch-all Segments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are developing a documentation website, we will have many features with each having many sub concepts. If we were to manage the routing for every single sub content there will be a huge number of files for each routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases we use Catch-all segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Image/I2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do it by defining a single Dynamic Routing File.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a `docs` folder inside which we will have a special dynamic folder i.e. `[...slug]` which will handle all the routings for `docs` URL.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "export default InnerDoc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've the slug, we can extract the parameters and based on that we can route to the respective pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, for a URL that does not matching any routes `NextJs` renders a default page.\n",

    "We can customize it,\n",

    "Our first solution would be to create separate folders for each of the Authentication task. Yes we can do that but it does not improve the readability of the our project for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead what we can do is we can create a parent directory i.e. `auth` and move our previously created folders inside this folder. It works and a new URL segment gets added to our URL path i.e. `localhost:3000/auth/login`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is a problem, why do we need `auth` in our `URL` path when we do not have any file that is specific to `localhost:3000/auth/` we will get a `404` page error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this we've `Route Groups`, to make our `auth` folder Route Group we can enclose the name of the folder with `()` i.e. `(auth)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we won't need to include `auth/` in our URL path to access any of the Authentication feature.\n",
