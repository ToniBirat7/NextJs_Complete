    "## **What is `Next.js`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` is a `React framework` that provides a structure to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is built on top of `React` and provides features like `server-side rendering`, `static site generation`, `API routes`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provided features like `file-based routing`, `image optimization`, `Data Fetching`, `Bundling and Minification`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a `Full Stack Framework`, therefore it has `Opinions` and `Conventions` to follow.\n",

    "### **Features of `Next.js`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**File-based Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `Next.js`, the files inside the `pages` directory are automatically mapped to routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, a file named `about.js` inside the `pages` directory will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/about`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` allows you to create API endpoints inside the `pages/api` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can create both `Client Side` React Components and `Server Side` API routes in the same project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rendering Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` supports multiple rendering methods, including `Static Site Generation (SSG)`, `Server-Side Rendering (SSR)`, and `Client-Side Rendering (CSR)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This flexibility allows developers to choose the best rendering method for their specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Fetching**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` provides built-in methods for data fetching, such as `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Styling**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` supports various styling options, including `CSS`, `Sass`, `CSS-in-JS`, and `Tailwind CSS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also has built-in support for `CSS Modules`, allowing for scoped and modular styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` has a built-in `Image` component that automatically optimizes images for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It supports features like lazy loading, resizing, and serving images in modern formats like `WebP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It also has built-in support for `Internationalization (i18n)`, making it easier to create multilingual applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dev and Prod Build System**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Next.js` provides a robust build system that optimizes the application for both development and production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Developers can only focus on writing code, while `Next.js` handles the build optimizations.\n",

    "**Server Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NextJs all components are Server components by Default\n",
    "\n",
    "They've the ability to run tasks like reading files or fetching data from a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they do not have the ability to use hooks or handle user interactions\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "They are traditional React Components.\n",

    "### **Routing in NextJs**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Next.js` has a file system based routing mechanism. URL paths that users can access in the browser are defined by files and folders in your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "As NextJs is a framework so we will need to follow it's conventions to implement the features it provides. One of the feature is `File` based routing. Having said that we need to know that not every file in our project is `Routable`. Only those files that are inside the `app` folder are `Routable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Routing Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "All routes must be placed inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Routes` we need to create a dedicated folder for each route inside the `app` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want `localhost:3000/about` then we will need to have a folder `about` inside this folder there should be a `page.tsx` file for routing.\n",

    "## **Dynamic Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic routes are used when we want to create routes that are not predefined and can change based on user input or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dynamic route in Next.js, we use square brackets `[]` to define a dynamic segment in the folder name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we want to show product details based on product ID, we can create a folder named `[id]` inside the `app` folder. Inside this folder, we will have a `page.tsx` file that will handle rendering the product details based on the ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user navigates to a URL like `/product/123`, Next.js will match this URL to the dynamic route defined by the `[id]` folder and pass the value `123` as a parameter to the `page.tsx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Route Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a folder named `product` inside the `app` folder. Also, create `page.tsx` file inside the `product` folder to have a home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `product` folder, create another folder named `[productId]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inside the `[productId]` folder, create a file named `page.tsx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When user navigates to `/product/123`, the `page.tsx` file inside the `[productId]` folder will be rendered, and we can access the `productId` as a `Prop` in the `page.tsx` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "// src/app/product/[productId]/page.tsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "const ProductPage = async ({ params }: { params: { productId: string } }) => {\n",
    "  const product = await params;\n",
    "  return <div>Product ID: {product.productId}</div>;\n",
    "};\n",
    "export default ProductPage;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, we are using `params` prop to access the dynamic segment value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can create multiple dynamic segments by adding more folders with square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We receive `productId` as a prop in `products/[productId]/page.tsx` file. But the `params` prop is a `Promise` and we need to use `async/await` to access the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dynamic Nested Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create nested dynamic routes by combining static and dynamic segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to create a route for product reviews based on product ID and review ID, we can create the following folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app/product/[productId]/review/[reviewId]/page.tsx`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a route like `/product/123/review/456`, where `123` is the product ID and `456` is the review ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "import React from \"react\";\n",
    "\n",
    "const Reivew = async ({ params }: { params: { productId: string } }) => {\n",
    "  const param = await params;\n",

    "- Here, we are accessing the `productId` from the `params` prop in the `page.tsx` file inside the `review` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Catch-all Segments**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are developing a documentation website, we will have many features with each having many sub concepts. If we were to manage the routing for every single sub content there will be a huge number of files for each routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases we use Catch-all segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./Notes_Image/I2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do it by defining a single Dynamic Routing File.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a `docs` folder inside which we will have a special dynamic folder i.e. `[...slug]` which will handle all the routings for `docs` URL.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "export default InnerDoc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've the slug, we can extract the parameters and based on that we can route to the respective pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, for a URL that does not matching any routes `NextJs` renders a default page.\n",

    "We can customize it,\n",

    "\n",
    "- `options`: An optional object that can contain the following properties:\n",

    "import { redirect } from \"next/navigation\";\n",
    "export default function Page() {\n",

    "**Parallel Routes Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To create `Parallel Routes`, we implement a feature called `Slots` using `@` symbol in folder names.\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Parallel Routes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before `Parallel Routes`, all sections were tightly coupled with the layout, making it difficult to manage and scale. With `Parallel Routes`, each section is independent and can be managed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each section can have its own routing and state management. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns. With this feature, each section can have its own `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, and `error.tsx` files. It's like mini applications within the main application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors in one section do not affect the entire layout. Each section can have its own error handling using `error.tsx` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If some section takes longer to load, we can show a loading state for that specific section using `loading.tsx` file without affecting the other sections. Before, `Paralle l Routes`, if one section took longer to load, the entire layout would be blocked until that section was ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `User Analytics` section takes longer to load, we can create a `loading.tsx` file inside the `@analytics` folder to show a loading state for that specific section while the other sections are still accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another important benefit is `Sub Navigation`. Each section can have its own navigation within the section without affecting the main layout navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the `User Management` section can have its own navigation to manage users, while the main layout navigation remains unaffected. Say, `localhost:3000/dashboard` is the main layout URL, and `localhost:3000/dashboard/` for the `Dashboard` page. Now, inside the `User Management` section, we can have URLs like `localhost:3000/dashboard/user-management/active-users` and `localhost:3000/dashboard/user-management/inactive-users` for managing active and inactive users respectively.\n",

The server renders the server component and emits a placeholder for the client component which the browser downloads, hydrates, and runs.

    "\n",
    "I’ll describe what happens when a user requests the page containing your `ProductById` (server) that imports `OrderComp` (client).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Request arrives at server.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Server executes server components** (e.g. runs `generateMetadata`, `ProductById`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `ProductById` can `await` data fetching, compose UI, and **render HTML**.\n",
    "   - When the renderer encounters `<OrderComp />` (a client component), it **does not** render its inner HTML on the server in the same way. Instead the server:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Renders a placeholder/marker in the HTML stream (so the page structure is complete).\n",
    "     - Serializes the _props_ passed to that client component into the RSC payload (these props must be serializable — no functions).\n",
    "     - Emits metadata telling the client how to hydrate that component and what JS bundle to load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Server streams the HTML (and RSC payloads) to the browser.** The HTML is already usable (mostly), and the placeholder tells the client where the interactive component will mount.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Browser receives HTML and static assets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The static HTML is shown immediately (fast time-to-first-paint).\n",
    "   - The browser downloads the compiled JS bundle for the client component (only the code needed for that client component and its client-only dependencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hydration of client components**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The client runtime loads the client component bundle, finds the placeholder, deserializes props from the RSC payload, mounts the component, and hydrates it. Now the component runs as normal React in the browser.\n",
    "   - Event handlers become live and hooks (`useState`, `useRouter`) work.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interactivity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - When the user clicks your `Check Out` button, `handleClick` runs in the browser. `router.push('/')` triggers the App Router’s client-side navigation mechanism (it fetches the new route’s server-rendered data/HTML via the Flight protocol and performs a client transition without a full page reload).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Important constraints & gotchas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Props & serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Props you pass from server → client must be serializable (plain objects, primitives, arrays). **You cannot pass functions, class instances, or non-serializable values.**\n",

    "### No server-only hooks in client, and no client-only hooks in server\n",

    "### Performance & shipping JS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client components add JS to the browser. Keep them small and localize interactivity to minimize shipped JS.\n",
    "- Prefer server components for static layout and only use client components where you need interactivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hydration & streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the HTML is server-rendered, the page becomes visible before client components hydrate. That’s the performance win of RSC.\n",
    "- Suspense boundaries can delay rendering of parts of the page until data or client bundles are ready; Next uses streaming + suspense.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5) How navigation works (brief)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicking a `next/link` in a client component or calling `router.push()` uses the App Router’s client navigation.\n",
    "- The router fetches the new route via the RSC/Flight endpoint (server still produces the UI), but the browser performs an in-place update (no full page reload) — this preserves client state for mounted client components where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6) Put it together for your code (`ProductById` + `OrderComp`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ProductById` is a **server component** (it’s `async`, uses `generateMetadata`, reads params/searchParams). It composes UI and includes `<OrderComp />`.\n",
    "- `OrderComp` is a **client component** (`\"use client\"`). On the server the renderer outputs a mount point; on the client the code is downloaded and hydrated.\n",
    "- `router.push(\"/\")` in `OrderComp` works because it runs in the browser after hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about your typing:** `params` and `searchParams` are plain objects provided by Next at runtime. They are not Promises in typical usage — don’t `await` them. (You earlier awaited them which works but is unnecessary; also types are erased at runtime so validate inputs if you require specific values.)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7) Practical tips & best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your root layout and most UI as server components. Use small client components for interactions (buttons, forms, modals).\n",
    "- Pass minimal serializable props to client components (e.g., `productId`, `initialCount`) and lift heavy data fetching to the server component.\n",
    "- Use `use client` only at the top of files that truly need it. Avoid putting `\"use client\"` on large layout files — that forces the whole layout.client bundle to ship.\n",
    "- Validate query/search params at runtime (don’t rely on TS types for runtime constraints).\n",
    "- Use React `Suspense` for client components that might take time to hydrate, so you can show placeholders.\n",

    "Great — let’s unpack **hydration** from first principles and then walk through concrete examples, common failures, and debugging fixes. I’ll keep it practical so you can apply it to your Next.js + App Router work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is hydration? (short)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hydration** is the process where client-side JavaScript takes server-rendered HTML and \"wires up\" interactive behavior to it (event handlers, hooks, client state). The browser shows the static HTML immediately (fast paint), then the JavaScript runs, attaches listeners, and makes the page interactive — that process is hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why it exists\n",
    "\n",
    "- Server rendering (SSR) gives fast first paint and better SEO because HTML is already present.\n",
    "- But HTML alone is static — no event handlers, `useState`, or `useEffect`. To get interactivity you must run JS in the browser and _rehydrate_ the DOM so React can take over without throwing away the server-rendered output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# High-level steps (what actually happens)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Server renders HTML for the page and sends it to the browser.\n",
    "2. Browser parses and displays HTML (fast).\n",
    "3. Browser downloads the client JavaScript bundle(s).\n",
    "4. React on the client runs and _hydrates_ the existing DOM:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It creates the virtual DOM representation of the UI.\n",
    "   - It reconciles the virtual DOM with the browser DOM produced by the server.\n",
    "   - It attaches event listeners and initializes component state/hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The page becomes fully interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simple concrete example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a page with a counter that is server-rendered but interactive on the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Server component output (HTML sent to browser):\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!-- Served HTML (static) -->\n",
    "<div id=\"root\">\n",
    "  <button id=\"inc\">Count: 0</button>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "<script src=\"/_next/static/chunk/client-counter.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Client JS (hydration code) runs and attaches event handler:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// client-counter.js (simplified)\n",
    "const btn = document.getElementById(\"inc\");\n",
    "let count = 0;\n",
    "btn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n",
    "  count++;\n",
    "  btn.textContent = `Count: ${count}`;\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When JS runs, it finds the existing button and _hydrates_ — reuses the DOM node (no full re-render), attaches listeners and client state, and becomes interactive. This is hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example in React / Next (server + client split)\n",
    "\n",
    "Server component: `app/page.tsx`\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "// server component (app/page.tsx)\n",

    "    <main>\n",
    "      <h1>Counter</h1>\n",
    "      <ClientCounter initialCount={0} />\n",

    "\n",
    "- Server renders the `<button>Count: 0</button>` into HTML.\n",
    "- Browser shows it.\n",
    "- Client JS downloads `ClientCounter` bundle, hydrates that button node, sets up state (`useState(initialCount)`), and attaches the `onClick` handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hydration mismatch — what it is and common causes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hydration mismatch** happens when the DOM produced on the server does not match what React expects on the client during hydration. React will warn (and may replace or discard nodes) because the virtual DOM differs from the real DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-deterministic values during render**: `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`. Server value != client value.\n",
    "- **Locale-dependent formatting**: `new Date().toLocaleString()` may produce different strings server vs client.\n",
    "- **Using browser-only APIs on server** (conditional branches with `typeof window !== 'undefined'`) that change markup.\n",
    "- **Extensions or injected attributes**: browser extensions can alter HTML before React hydrates (e.g. `cz-shortcut-listen=\"true\"`), producing mismatch.\n",
    "- **Different data passed client vs server** (e.g. serializing props incorrectly).\n",
    "- **Mixing server/client rendering rules incorrectly** (e.g., making a layout a client component and expecting server-only behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Console warnings about hydration mismatch.\n",
    "- Some elements missing event handlers or different attributes.\n",
    "- Visual flicker or UI differences after hydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example causing mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "export default function Page() {\n",
    "  return <div>Date: {new Date().toISOString()}</div>;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Client (during hydration) will evaluate `new Date().toISOString()` again and produce a different timestamp — mismatch occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix: Render a stable string on the server, or move client-only values into a client component that hydrates and replaces a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How React handles a mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "- If mismatched, React may log warnings and attempt to patch differences. In some cases it will throw away the server DOM subtree and re-render on the client (costly). Newer React versions are more tolerant but mismatches still hurt performance and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advanced: streaming SSR and partial hydration (React 18 / Next.js)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streaming SSR**: server sends HTML in chunks (streaming). React can stream server-rendered HTML progressively; client hydrates as chunks arrive. This improves TTFB/TTI. Next.js uses streaming with RSC (React Server Components) and Flight protocol.\n",
    "- **Partial hydration / Islands architecture**: framework ships only JS for interactive parts (islands) and hydrates those; other parts remain static. Next.jsRSC + client components follow this idea: server components produce HTML, client components are islands that hydrate later.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Specifics for Next.js App Router & RSC\n",
    "\n",
    "- Server components produce HTML and also a Flight (RSC) payload describing client components and props. Client components are lazy-loaded by the browser and hydrated in place.\n",
    "- Props passed from server to client must be serializable (no functions).\n",
    "- Keep as much UI as server components as possible — only use client components for interactivity to reduce hydration JS.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Practical debugging checklist for hydration mismatches (do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **View Page Source** (raw server HTML). Compare to the DOM in Inspector after React mounts. Look for differences.\n",
    "2. Disable all browser extensions or test in Incognito — extensions often inject attributes.\n",
    "3. Search code for `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, `new Date().toLocaleString()` — move them into client components or make them deterministic.\n",
    "4. Ensure conditional rendering with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` doesn’t change markup between server & client — instead put that logic inside a client component.\n",
    "5. If using Tailwind or dynamic classes, ensure scaffolding isn’t changing class names server vs client (and Tailwind actually outputs those classes).\n",
    "6. If using server components importing client components, remember client JS hydrates later — temporarily replace client component with static markup to see if mismatch persists.\n",
    "7. Restart dev server to ensure build artifacts are fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example fix for a date mismatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: server renders a stable placeholder, client component hydrates and shows the dynamic time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Server`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "export default function Page() {\n",

    "- Mismatch happens when server and client produce different HTML.\n",
    "- Fix by moving dynamic/browser-only behavior into client components, validating inputs, and eliminating non-deterministic rendering on the server.\n",
    "- Prefer small client components for interactivity to reduce JS shipped and hydration work.\n",
